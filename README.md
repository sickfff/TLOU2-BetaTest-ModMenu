## 📖 About

This mod menu is a personal experimental project exploring modding possibilities in *The Last of Us Part II* on PC.  
It includes basic features such as:

- 👤 **Player Model Changer** (switch to NPCs like Joel, Tommy, Ellie)  
- 🧟 **Entity Spawner** (spawn infected, clickers, etc.)  
- 🔫 **Weapon Giver** (flamethrower, MP5, and more)  
- 🎬 **Cutscene Player** (trigger missions and scenes)

The GUI uses DirectX hooking to activate features in-game.

## 🚧 Development Status

- ⚙️ **Alpha/Beta stage:** Many functions are placeholders or incomplete.  
- 📚 The main goal is learning C++ and DirectX hooking techniques.  
- 🙌 Contributions and suggestions are welcome, but code is in early stages.
